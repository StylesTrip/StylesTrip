### Hello there ðŸ‘‹

## About Me
My Name is Ryan Turinsky. I am a father of two girls, husband, and software developer. I've spent most of my career as a backend Java developer who is now working his way through frontend development. I enjoy working on either frontend projects or full-stack projects when I can to. When I'm not doing any coding, you can find me shuttling my girls off to various practices, talking about comic books, or cheering on the Dallas Cowboys.
